# CMD Challenge

This challenge involved a series of command line tasks to test the knowledge and expertise in 

linux and bash and to also improve the command line skills.

## Steps I followed

1. Did the challenge taking screen shots at 3 milestones

2. Milestones were at 9, 18, and 27 tasks. 

3. Saved the screenshots in both .png and .jpg formats.

4. Created the repo on github, opened my sandbox and clone the repo.

5. Then I switched to the sftp command line tool to establish a connection between the sandbox environment and my local machine.
6. Then I moved the pictures into the local reporsitory on my machine. Then they could be seen with the lls command in the target directory

7. I used the SFTP put command to upload the screenshots from my local machine to the sandbox environment.

8. Used the bye command out of the sftp environment

9. Used git push to send my files to github
